## Inspiration

Inspired by Pride Month and the NYC Pride Parade tomorrow, we wanted to make a project that would provide resources and connect people supportive of the LGBTQ community.

## What it does

pride.tech is a facebook bot that allows users to rate different types of locations like businesses, parks, museums on their inclusivity and uses the users location to prompt them with rating places close to them. Our bot also allows users to see their supportive facebook friends locations so that during large events like the Pride Parade, you can find your friends and have fun!

## How I built it

This bot is built with javascript and the facebook api, hosted by heroku

## Challenges I ran into

we ran into a lot of github challenges in creating a new ssh key!! we have been struggling though creating our first ever chatbot, too!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We are so proud of 

## What I learned

We learned so much!! We loved learning from the mentors

## What's next for pride.tech

Next for pride.tech is the ability to ask users to rate locations so that it is a more simplified experience
